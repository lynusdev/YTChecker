# YTChecker

### DISCLAIMER: This is a proof of concept project!

YTChecker is a script that automatically claims abandoned youtube channels that haven't been claimed by their original owners yet. These youtube channels were created before Google bought YouTube and haven't been migrated to a google account yet. <br>

The script uses rotating residential proxies, the leakcheck api for getting passwords, a telegram bot and channel for both monitoring and publishing newly claimed accounts, selenium and undetected_chromedriver for scraping channels, logging in to google accounts, requests for trying to claim an account and much more!

I was able to claim a couple hundred channels per day, it was fun looking through all the old videos that people uploaded to them. Most of the channels had very few subscribers but it always was about the views, i mostly got channels with 1k-100k views, anything higher was pretty rare. The oldest [account](https://www.youtube.com/@tomd/about) i claimed was created on July 14th 2005, less than 3 months after youtubes initial release, being one of the first accounts ever created on the platform.
